This is the story of <a href="charles-sheet.html">Charles</a>.
</p><p>
Charles was born in the mid-to-late 1950's.
As a teenager he was drawn to the emerging genre of harder rock-n-roll music,
of 1970 like that of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qanF-91aJo">
Black Sabbath</a>.
During that time he had is own very unexpected brush with death.
Walking home a car was hurled through the air knocking him down as it flew by.
He surely would have died, but as he lay bleeding-out on the street, he heard a voice apologize and he felt almost as if he returned to his body, and his whole being seemed to almost knit back together.
Then the sirens, the medics the hospital.
Eventually, he was sent home.
His broken bones healed and he seemed fine.
Except, that he could see spirits all around him.
After some confusion with the doctors he kept to himself this new-found spirit
sight.
