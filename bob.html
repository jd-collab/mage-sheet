<h1>Bob</h1>
<p>
Bob is a Mage and mentor to <a href="charles.html">Charles</a>.
Bob is gifted with magic of <em>Death</em> and <em>Matter</em>.
</p><p>
Bob is a Vietnam war veteran.
In the war he served as a medic, where he saw a lot of <em>Death</em>.
</p><p>
After the war, Bob chose to spend his time tinkering with vans and motor bikes and largely kept to himself.
</p><p>
Bob recognized that Charles as an unaffiliated Mage and took him under his wing.
Later Bob presented Charles to the head Magi in area during their annual meeting.
</p><p>
Bob advised Charles to be careful to avoid getting entangled in Vampire politics.
To protect Charles, Bob drew-up a contract for <a href="diane.html">Diane</a> and Charles to sign.
The terms of the contract stated that Charles would not drink vampire blood and Diane would not try to harm or control Charles nor convert him to a vampire.
</p><p>
Bob's gift with <em>Matter</em> is evident as he provided Charles a magically enhanced vehicle as well as walkie-talkie which can reach Bob from anywhere.
