<h1>Charles</h1>
<p>
This is the story of <a href="charles-sheet.html">Charles</a>.
</p>
<h2>Early years</h2>
<p>
Charles was born in the mid-to-late 1950's.
</p>
<h3>Awakening</h3>
<p>
As a teenager he was drawn to the emerging genre of harder rock-n-roll music of the early 1970's like that of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qanF-91aJo">Black Sabbath</a>.
During that time he had is own very unexpected brush with death.
Walking home a car was hurled through the air knocking him down as it flew by.
He surely would have died, but as he lay bleeding-out on the street, he heard a voice apologize and he felt almost as if he returned to his body, and his whole being seemed to almost knit back together.
Then the sirens, the medics, the hospital, doctors, his parents, and later the police.
Eventually, he was sent home.
His broken bones healed and he seemed fine.
Except, that he could see spirits all around him.
After some confusion with the doctors he kept to himself this new-found spirit sight.
</p>
<h3>Girl's ghost</h3>
<p>
While Charles sees spirits and ghosts that others do not, mostly these pay little attention to him.
One however, started speaking to him.
The ghost's voice was that of a girl, probably younger than Charles, speaking in what seemed like snatches of thought, as if re-experiencing moments of pain.
Charles follows the ghost to a spot in the church lawn, and indicates that is the location of her body, at the hands of the abusing priest.
With his friends, Charles and crew spray-paint accusation of murder and unholiness over the church lawn and draw particular attention to the spot.
This causes enough of a spectacle, that not only does the news come out, buy so do the police.
Eventually, the spot is dug up, the body exhumed, and the priest exposed.
</p>
<h3>Recognized</h3>
<p>
Having graduated high school, Charles decides to leave his hometown.
Before heading to yet more school, he takes a trip to New Orleans where he will be able to drink at age 18.
Not knowing anyone there, he doesn't have that wild of a time, but he takes in a bit of the music and the atmosphere.
Also, there are plenty of wandering spirits and ghosts.
A street preacher singles him out and tells Charles that he can see that Charles has "the sight".
Charles leave, but takes note of the preacher, and catches up with him that evening in a now empty street.
The preacher says that he knew Charles would follow him.
In their conversation the Preacher asks if Charles can give him his gifts, but Charles has no idea how it came to him and can not pass it to another.
The preacher is disappointed but wishes him well.
As they part, the preacher assures him that stranger things lie ahead.
</p>
<h2>Chicago</h2>
As a young adult, Charles moves to Chicago, enrolls in school to study ancient languages, gets an inexpensive apartment outside of the city not far from campus, and gets an easy job at a grocery store.
<h3>Graveyard acquaintance</h3>
<p>
Near Charles house is a graveyard, with what was once a small church and a small house on the property.
The oldest stones are from the 1910's and the latest ones are from the early 1950s, after which the graveyard seems to have been treated as full.
The church is now a seldom-used administrative building for the graveyard, and the small house is now rented out as a lawyer's office.
Unlike newer graveyards which are completely fenced-in after hours, this one has an area near the church's parking with stone benches looking out over the gravestones.
Charles makes an evening routine of studying on these benches below the large lamp while listening to the spirits and ghosts which come and go from the area.
It might be trespassing, but there is no sign which says so, and no one has ever asked him to move along.
He is particularly fond of the singing that one ghost has a habit of doing nearly every night.
</p>
<p>
One evening, while reading, Charles sense someone approach.
With his supernatural <em>mage sight</em>, Charles can see this person has a black void withing them where they should have a soul.
The individual is a woman who introduces herself as <a href="diane.html">Diane</a>.
Diane confronts Charles about why he is in her <i>demesne</i>.
Charles assures her that he simply enjoys reading while surrounded by the comfort of spirits which appear to dwell within her domain; undisturbed and free of interruption by the living.
Diane appears to accept the explanation, and informs Charles that she permits him in her <i>demesne</i> for the time being.
