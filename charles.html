<h1>Charles</h1>
<p>
This is the story of <a href="charles-sheet.html">Charles</a>.
</p>
<h2>Early years</h2>
<p>
Charles was born in the mid-to-late 1950's.
</p>
<h3 id="awakening">Awakening</h3>
<p>
As a teenager he was drawn to the emerging genre of harder rock-n-roll music of
the early 1970's like that of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qanF-91aJo">Black Sabbath</a>.
During that time he had is own very unexpected brush with death.
Walking home a car was hurled through the air knocking him down as it flew by.
He surely would have died, but as he lay bleeding-out on the street,
he heard a voice apologize and he felt almost as if he returned to his body,
and his whole being seemed to almost knit back together.
Then the sirens, the medics, the hospital, doctors, his parents,
and later the police.
Eventually, he was sent home.
His broken bones healed and he seemed fine.
Except, that he could see spirits all around him.
After some confusion with the doctors
he kept to himself this new-found <em>spirit sight</em>.
</p>
<h3 id="girl-s-ghost">Girl's ghost</h3>
<p>
While Charles sees spirits and ghosts that others do not,
mostly these pay little attention to him.
One however, started speaking to him.
The ghost's voice was that of a girl, probably younger than Charles,
speaking in what seemed like snatches of thought,
as if re-experiencing moments of pain.
Charles follows the ghost to a spot in the church lawn,
and indicates that is the location of her body,
at the hands of the abusing priest.
With his friends,
Charles and crew spray-paint accusation of murder and unholiness
over the church lawn and draw particular attention to the spot.
This causes enough of a spectacle,
that not only does the news camera crew come out, but so do the police.
Eventually, the spot is dug up, the body exhumed, and the priest exposed.
</p>
<h3 id="recognized">Recognized</h3>
<p>
Having graduated high school, Charles decides to leave his hometown.
Before heading to yet more school,
he takes a trip to New Orleans where he will be able to drink at age 18.
Not knowing anyone there, he doesn't have too wild of a time,
rather he takes in a bit of the music and the atmosphere.
Also, there are plenty of wandering spirits and ghosts.
A street preacher singles him out
and tells Charles that he can see that Charles has <em>"the sight"</em>.
Charles leaves, but takes note of the preacher.
</p>
<p>
Charles catches up with the preacher that evening in a now empty street.
The preacher says that he knew Charles would follow him.
In their conversation the Preacher asks if Charles can give him his gifts,
but Charles has no idea how it came to him and can not pass it to another.
The preacher is disappointed but wishes him well.
As they part, the preacher assures him that stranger things lie ahead.
</p>
<h2 id="chicago">Chicago</h2>
As a young adult, Charles moves to Chicago,
enrolls in school to study ancient languages,
gets an inexpensive apartment outside of the city not far from campus,
and gets an easy job at a grocery store.
<h3 id="graveyard-acquaintance">Graveyard acquaintance</h3>
<p>
A few minute's walk from Charles' apartment is a graveyard
with what was once a small church and a small house on the property.
The oldest gravestones are from the 1910's
and the latest ones are from the early 1950's,
after which the graveyard seems to have been treated as full.
The church is now a seldom-used administrative building for the graveyard,
and the small house is now rented out as a lawyer's office.
Unlike newer graveyards which are completely fenced-in after hours,
this one has an area near the church's parking
with stone benches looking out over the gravestones.
</p>
<p>
Charles makes an evening routine of studying on these benches
below the large lamp
while listening to the spirits and ghosts which come and go from the area.
It might be trespassing, but there is no sign which says so,
and no one has ever asked him to move along.
He is particularly fond of the beautiful and gentle singing
that a ghost named Mary has a habit of engaging in nearly every night.
</p>
<p>
One evening, while reading, Charles sense someone approach.
With his supernatural <em>mage sight</em>,
Charles can see this person has a black void within them
where they should have a soul.
The woman introduces herself as <a href="diane.html">Diane</a>.
Diane confronts Charles about why he is in her
<i><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/demesne">demesne</a></i>.
Charles assures her that he simply enjoys reading
while surrounded by the comfort of spirits
which appear to dwell within her domain;
undisturbed and free of interruption by the living.
Diane appears to accept the explanation,
and informs Charles that she permits him in her <i>demesne</i>
for the time being.

<p>
Diane wanted to consult with her priest in Gary, IN.
The priest indicated unspoken support for Diane to flee Chicago.
Obtained vehicle from Bob and his blessings (magical walkie-talkies).
Settled in Victoria for about 6 months then to Mexico for a few.
Now headed to Las Vegas (reputed to be a wild free city).
</p>
<h3 id="a-show-like-no-other">A show like no other</h3>
<p>
Charles and Diane arrive in Vegas, get a hotel,
and plan to spend a bit of time to get a feel for the city
before they try to settle in.
Diane spots a bar that is marked;
inside they see the staff are ghouls and patrons are all sorts of super-natural:
vampires, mage, and werewolf.
They get introduced to James,
an old-west era vampire who explains that if you have any trouble,
take it out to the desert and keep it outside of Vegas
then everyone can get along.
James describes Vegas as still "the wild west"
without the same law as other places.
Charles discovers that one of the smaller newspapers also contains magical news
that can be read with his <i>mage sight</i>,
it includes help wanted ads.
Given the number of missing persons posters,
Charles starts collecting some
to try to get a feel for how big of a problem it is.
After some weeks,
he estimates that it is higher than the national average but not absurdly high.
While collecting sample posters,
Charles is warned by a woman on the street
that there is a cult who has taken her now-missing son.
Charles and Diane get an apartment,
Diane starts advertising as a dominatrix
and starts separating men from their money
and the clients willing let her feed upon them
and they all leave feeling fulfilled.
Charles discovers Mr. Wonder's Wonderous Emporium,
and the woman working there provides him with a magical guidebook for Vegas;
among other things,
it spells out the rules (which align with what James said)
and makes an extremely strong point of not endangering tourists
or drawing attention from outside.
Charles follows up on a magical help wanted advert
and gets hired to work in a library run by a woman, Martha,
who is very old and seemingly quite powerful,
but physically starting to fade;
Charles helps out 4 days a week, gets reasonable pay,
and has access to an incredible library for his studies.
</p><p>
Charles discovers a link between missing people
and a club just outside the city called The Temple of Isis,
and so Charles and Diane elect to go check it out.
A ghoul is at the door, who lets them pass,
and they get their tickets to the show.
The club is not too busy, but the acts are good, then comes the main act:
Isis herself comes out on stage and begins to sing beautifully.
Diane insists they leave immediately, which they do,
and remains tight-lipped about the reason until they are back at the apartment.
She explains that Isis is a vampire who is ancient,
at least one thousand years old maybe two, maybe more, who knows?
Charles, wanting to ensure they have not created an enemy,
pens a card to the club, thanking them for the opportunity,
complementing them on all of the performances,
and expressing regret that they had to leave at the start of the very best act.
About ten days later,
a letter arrives containing VIP tickets for an upcoming evening.
They rent a limo, dress up, and attend.
The others in attendance are mostly people Charles recognizes
from politicians to Madonna.
The show is mesmerizing,
and all in attendance are nearly captivated by the performance of Isis.
After the show, Charles and Diane are invited to the opulent back-stage lounge,
where a few other super-naturals are relaxing.
Isis comes into the room and mingles with the small number of guests.
Charles and Diane each introduce themselves
and freely give candid, if brief, accounts of themselves.
Isis says that she hopes they will become friends.
When they leave Diane still seems a bit captivated by Isis,
and Charles comments that he can imagine people easily lose themselves in Isis.
</p>
<h3 id="return-to-isis">Return to Isis</h3>
<p>
A month or two later, and another VIP invite to The Temple of Isis arrives.
Charles and Diane attend again well dressed,
but this time electing to drive themselves in the van that Bob souped-up,
rather than bother with a fancy limo.
The are seated at a table for four, and shortly after
they are seated in walk a pair of women who are directed towards them.
Charles smiles and shakes his head a bit;
with his <i>mage sight</i> he can see that one of the women is a powerful mage
and the other is a vampire.
The stunningly beautiful mage looks too young for the power she radiates.
Charles thinks she looks like she might come from the Pacific Archipelago,
perhaps Indonesia, and if so,
also notes that she's rather tall for someone of that region.
Diane reports that the vampire the mage is with seems to be quite old
and powerful as well.
A staff member introduces Kailani and Lauraine to Charles and Diane,
and gets drink orders.
Diane and the mage Kailani decide to dance for a bit,
while Charles and Lauraine, the vampire, watch from the table
and become engrossed in the topic of ancient languages.
When the dancers return, there is chance to switch partners,
and the two mages and the two vampires each take measure of each other
as suitable small-talk is exchanged.
Naturally, they feel rather "set up" by Isis,
but all seem to trust her judgement well enough
and through-out dinner and the show, hit it off reasonably well.
</p><p>
The evening comes, and Charles offers them a lift back to their flat in town,
as Lauraine had expressed interest in seeing the "magic bus".
After the crowd has thinned-out, they head out to the parking lot,
only to discover that the car has been tampered with.
Charles voices that they should return inside to collect a forgotten article
and the four nonchalantly go back in and ask to report an incident.
A Temple staff vampire arrives
and is quite disturbed to learn that a vehicle was tampered with.
The five return to the parking lot
where Charles performs a ritual to look for <i>matter</i> changes in the van.
Sure enough, he discovers a bomb has been wired in,
which he is able to remove
and hands it to the Temple vampire who will appropriately deal with it.
</p><p>
As they prepare to leave the lot,
members of Diane's clan are waiting at a roadblock.
Charles asks everyone to tighten their seat-belts and hang on.
In a physics defying move,
the van goes off-road to whip around the roadblock
as it accelerates to over 200 mph.
Reaching out with her mind, Kailani reports greater trouble ahead:
a tanker truck is heading their way also at high speed
and the driver of the truck is exiting the cab.
Kailani says she can't get a good read on the driver,
but is also aware of a man in a car ways away in the desert, waiting.
The van slows slightly
as the occupants see tanker starting to swerve out of control
and begin to roll taking up all lanes on the road.
In a blink, Lauraine exits the moving van,
which is still moving at over 100 miles per hour,
to find the man in the car.
Charles once again takes the van off-road into the desert
to avoid the tanker truck.
Once distanced from that,
Kailani assures the others that Lauraine will be fine
and the three elect to go to Kailani and Lauraine's to await her return.
There, they draft a letter to Diane's clan
explaining that the vampire hunters followed their group
in order to locate Diane and Charles
and that for everyone's safety they will continue to be in hiding.
Lauraine returns, hurt, and having obviously had a very bad encounter.
She expresses that the man was very dangerous, but does not share the details.
However she sees the wisdom in reporting what has transpired,
so the four of them expand the letter and Kailani transports Lauraine to Ohio
so that the letter can be delivered.
It seems Lauraine may not have been as diplomatic as Diane would have liked,
but the message was effectively delivered.
</p>
<h3 id="unexpected-visit">Unexpected Visit</h3>
<p>
Sr. A. Biaxxa, "Mr. Summer" and a young woman "Mrs. Winter" visited.
They are connected to a supernatural Judaic order.
Kailani's past reaches back to 1905 or earlier, involves a demon in some way.
Lauraine's past is also quite dark.
Mister Summer would like the Heart of Solomon returned to his people.
The Heart of Solomon may be useful in reconnecting a soul to a person and more.
</p>
<h3 id="ghosts-of-prey">Ghosts of Prey</h3>
<p>
<a href="bob.html">Bob</a> calls and reports that he's driving in to town.
Charles invites Bob to his apartment
and they grill burgers on the balcony BBQ grill,
and catch up over some cans of beer.
Charles relates all the goings-on to Bob
with the Temple of Isis and Kailani and the vampire hunters.
Bob reports that ancient vampires are feuding in Chicago,
and thus he decided to leave in order to stay clear of the mess.
As such, Bob has bought a square mile of desert outside of town
to set himself with an automobile shop on the road
and a secluded house in the back 40.
Bob offers to further soup-up Charles' van with some new magic he's leaned.
The two of them work for a few days after which
the van now has a button which opens a new door on the inside of the van
behind which a large magical space can be accessed,
if they wish they could make that an apartment while on the road.
Bob then installs a magical maps system
which has maps of North America and Europe.
They add magic to the van allowing it to operate as a boat or even submarine.
Finally Bob installs an autopilot unit and names the van Rover.
</p>
<p>
A few days later,
Lucille, a ghost that Charles knows, and a couple other ghosts
are looking for Charles when he comes home.
He invites them into the apartment
and learns that several ghosts have gone missing.
Fearing the worst, Charles goes out to the graveyard
where the area ghosts tend to gather to see what he can learn.
Using his <i>sight</i>
he detects that Death magic has been performed here recently
by a group of people, but none of the ghosts know by whom.
Charles lays upon the ground
and reaches with his mind out to the spirit of the ground around him,
and is greeted in the twilight by the spirit,
personified as a very old and very hunched over Native American woman.
The spirit is persuaded that while the atrocities of the past can not be undone,
helping Charles find who has been harming the ghosts
could prevent some further atrocities.
Next, Charles goes to find the haunt of a ghost
who was once a detective in life,
and remained after death to find the murderer,
but has also gone missing.
In the area he finds a bone whistle with some feathers attached;
it has been recently used in death magic.
Charles pays a visit to James,
the old cowboy vampire whom made it clear that he doesn't like trouble.
Charles reports the trouble of ghosts going missing via Death Magic,
and James tells him that it is a Indian eagle-bone whistle
used in dances and rituals.
Charles takes the whistle in to work
and tells Martha all of what has been going on with the missing ghosts.
Martha says she can do scrying and use the whistle,
but that naturally comes with risks of being discovered
by those that one is scrying upon;
he leaves the whistle with her.
When Charles next comes to work, he finds her dead;
the place has been ransacked and the whistle is gone.
Charles calls Bob and he comes out to help; Diane will join after dark.
Just as dark sets in,
Charles is attacked by three mages who emerge from the twilight
with blades shaped from Ephemera.
Charles shapes Ephemera armor over himself
and creates blinding darkness around the attackers.
Tisiphone, the righteous fury grows to be huge with wings,
screams as she attacks one of the three.
Charles shapes the darkness around the two others, who then vanish to escape.
Charles then takes the body of Martha and the assailant
to the local head of the Mages and reports what has happened so far.
The Mages agree that this is serious,
someone is consuming ghosts as a power source
and they assign two agents to help Charles find out who is doing it.
Charles visits the local reservation
and learns that the whistle is not something from their tribe,
but more likely Lakota.
Charles goes the Native American Heritage museum
and learns that the whistle, and a ghost shirt were recently stolen from there.
Charles receives the case information
and photocopies of pictures of the missing items.
</p>
<h3 id="ominous-tidings">Ominous tidings</h3>
<p>
Charles dreams of a younger spirit of the land coming to him,
in the dream the spirit shows him a ranch-house on the outskirts of town
and compels him to go there to track the ghost destroying magic.
Charles wakes, calls Bob and tells him where he's going,
Bob offers to meet him and Diane on the way.
Charles contacts the Mages, and they send an agent out to meet them.
Bob and Charles park a ways away from the ranch,
they hide the vehicles in shadow.
Looking around, Bob and Charles and the agent,
can tell there is a person inside the house,
and it seems there is also some movement.
Bob takes Charles and the Agent through the twilight to get inside of the house.
Once inside they find the body of a young woman;
there are signs of death magic, but no other signs of life.
When trying to determine the cause of death, the young woman wakes.
After some initial confusion,
the young woman admits that she was trying to hide by playing dead.
Tisiphone seems suspicious of the girl.
Charles questions the young woman,
and it is revealed that she was participating in some of the rituals
of these mages who are doing the ghost things
in hopes of learning magic herself.
A message on the answering machine is from someone warning that
"Ominous" is coming and they need to get away.
After some exchange with the Agent,
Charles tells the young woman that she needs to come with them to the Mages.
The young woman says she will refuse,
and Charles makes it clear that she will not have a choice in this.
At this the young woman reaches out and performs some magic
and orders Diane to kill the agent,
then shrouds herself in darkness.
Diane dispatches the agent seemingly effortlessly.
Charles calls to Tisiphone
who becomes large, howls, and dives upon the young woman.
In that moment, the woman and Tisiphone vanish into the twilight.
Charles looks in to Diane's black eyes,
and with all his energy and the words "Come back to me",
breaks the mind control spell.
Bob says that they can try to follow the woman through the twilight,
but it will be very dangerous.
Charles suggests that they get the body of the agent back to the Mages.
Charles' commands his van to head back to the parking garage of his apartment,
as the sun will rise soon, Diane will go with the van.
Charles and Bob make a full report as they delivers a <em>second</em> dead mage
and provide the tape from the answering machine.
Fortunately, the mages are able to bring the agent back to life.
A Mage with time powers is able to reconstruct some of the goings-on,
and it turns out that a young woman was indeed killed and "Ominous",
the woman that vanished,
had tried to pose as the girl's corpse.
</p>
<p>
A couple of days later,
a ghost says they've found one of the mages who is one of the ghost destroyers.
From that clue, Charles, Bob, Diane all follow the man
who heads to an old church on the edge of the old city and disappears inside.
Oddly, ghosts seem drawn to this church,
but it is protected by a large and powerful magical barrier
through which ghosts seemingly can not pass.
Charles calls the Mages for back up;
moments later two mages materialize and ask how they can help.
Just then a woman speeds up on a motorcycle, stops, steps off
and starts heading to the church with a sub machine gun.
Diane says, "that's her" and bolts towards her.
As Diane encounters Ominous,
she's struck down, seemingly effortlessly by Ominous,
who hardly breaks her purposeful stride
as she enters the church through the front doors.
Bob and one of the agents agree to enter in on the left
and Charles and the other to the right.
Inside, Ominous and an old priest are arguing.
From the argument is seems that the old man may be her actual grandfather
and he calls her by what may be her actual name.
Shots ring out in rapid fire as she guns down the priest.
Bob, Charles, and the two agents all start firing on "Ominous"
who laughs as the bullets pass right through her;
under her leather motorcycle jacket, the stolen ghost shirt can be seen.
Charles can see that she has the eagle bone whistle
and some form of Native American head-gear as well.
She takes some items from the old priest, and vanishes.
Charles runs out to the stairs to find Diane's body,
and amazingly Diane is hurt but returns to consciousness,
so Charles takes her home.
That night, the old spirit of the land returns to Charles in a dream
and tells him that he must follow the guide.
The dream is broken by the ring of the telephone.
On the phone is Susan, the woman from the Native American Heritage museum,
who tells him that she's discovered more items have been stolen.
Charles drives to the Museum to meet her.
After he gets photocopies of pictures of the missing head-gear,
the two of them talk.
Charles carefully explains that he is not working with the police,
because he's with people that have different strengths,
and their powers are not all that different
than the powers of the shamans of her ancestors.
Charles levels with her that the people who have stolen these items
have stolen them for the power the items contain.
In what strikes Charles as an overly black-and-white question,
she asks if he and his group are the good guys who can stop the "bad guys"
and get the items back.
He tells her that this is what he intends to do.

<h3 id="knights-of-the-round">Knights of the Round</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Magda asked Charles to help prevent Modred from obtaining Excalibur</li>
    <li>Charles, Magda, and Diane
	pay another visit to Magda's great grand mother,
	over tea, they learn that to speak with the Lady of the Lake,
	they must visit realm</li>
    <li>Being June of 1987, the days are long, nights are short,
	Magda uses a strange magic allowing Diane to be in daylight for a time,
	though not at full strength</li>
    <li>Magda takes them to a fairy ring, and leads the activation dance</li>
    <li>As uninvited outsiders, Charles, the demon Magda, and the vampire Diane,

    <li>The queen assigns the hobgoblin "Robin" to lead them there and to lead

    <li>Charles explains that Modred, now a fay vampire seeks Excalibur</li>
    <li>The Lady declares that if Modred obtains Excalibur,
	this would mean the death of the world</li>
    <li>Charles explains that it is their intention to return Excalibur to
	the Lady of the Lake, so that that Modred, does not obtain it</li>
    <li>The Lady then charges the three of them with that very mission,
	and dubs them knights</li>
    <li>When asked for something to help them locate the Future King,
	The Lady of the Lake, extracts a hair of Arthur from his tomb,
	and with that creates a vision of a girl who was given Excalibur</li>
    <li>When the three return from the Lady's island,
	Robin eventually shows back up and starts to take them back</li>
    <li>Along the way, Robin find the ingredients for making some beverage which
	makes him quite tipsy and continuously offers it to the three</li>
    <li>Robin insists that he has enchanted the drink such that it will send
	them back home, but Charles insists that this is not the way</li>
    <li>Quite offended, Robin believes that Charles has called him a liar,
	and angrily creates a portal to send them back</li>
    <li>Back in the mortal world, Charles visits Kailani,
	she is able to create a painting of the girl via mind reading</li>
    <li>Eventually it clicks that this is a younger version of the cat burglar
	who stole the Aegis and is a <i>null</i></li>
    <li>She has moved; Charles leaves his card with the neighbor</li>
    <li>Posing as Interpol seeking an art thief,
	they get the girls car info</li>
    <li>They track the car to a hotel, and pay a visit to her room</li>
    <li>The girl indeed has Excalibur
	and is persuaded to go to Avalon to talk to the Lady of the Lake</li>
    <li>The Lady tells the girl that she descends from Uther Pendragon,
	and thus is the rightful bearer of Excalibur</li>
    <li>Charles suggests to the girl that she should stay with the Lady
	until she is ready to wield Excalibur to lead the world</li>
    <li>Charles, completes his suggestion with "Your Majesty", and kneels
	and Magda and Diane kneel as well</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="return-home">Return home</h3>
<ul>
    <li>returned to library, set Martha on a pedestal</li>
    <li>Met with Bob, some additional securing of the library</li>
    <li>Loraine came by, needed help with a prisoner,
	but Charles was unable to help;
	the prisoner (Loraine called a "nosy person")
	was almost catatonic after years of isolation</li>
    <li>Charles was upset about the situation
	and Loraine wiped his memory of the events</li>
    <li>Charles realized she had done something,
	she told him, offered to restore his memory;
	Charles declined
	stating he did not want to be involved with her business,
	she apologized.
   </li>
    <li>Paid a visit to Cowboy James,
	gave him a brief update about his time in the UK
	and his service to prince Renier, and knighthood,
	both agreed it was not a problem
   </li>
    <li>Visit Isis, more detailed update,
	including discussion of Mordred and mob boss</li>
    <li>received invitation to mob boss' daughter's wedding</li>
    <li>at wedding, during the receiving line,
	three black SUVs arrived, shooting the crowd</li>
    <li>the daughter and groom each died,
	Charles caused the lead and trailing SUV's engines to fail,
	allowing and the capture of the assassins,
	with Diane's and the fury's aid.</li>
    <li>The mob boss thanked Charles
	and expressed that was in Charles' debt.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mob-funeral">Mob funeral</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Charles contacts the Mages in the city,
	and starts to work on a plan for restoring Martha,
	expecting the research to take years, perhaps a decade,
	and to require casters of all schools of magic to participate.</li>
    <li>Charles attends the funeral of the mob boss daughter and groom.</li>
    <li>At the service, mostly close family members, the mayor, some others;
	the ghosts present include
	an elderly couple,
	a woman,
	a child,
	the mob boss daughter and groom.</li>
    <li>The blessing of the deceased and the Funeral Rite is performed by
	the priest who is a member of the mob boss family,
	and includes the use of their family member's reliquary.</li>
    <li>Near the end of the rite, Charles observes the reliquary radiating,
	a hole open in the shadow,
	something dark seem to emerge,
	then the spirits of the daughter and groom are sucked into the hole,
	and it closes and vanishes.</li>
    <li>About a week later, Charles comes home
	to find his house without its enchantments;
	strangely, he was not alerted when they were disabled.</li>
    <li>He calls Bob, who comes over to help him investigate.</li>
    <li>Bob discovers a "bug" that Charles overlooked;
	a mage must have installed as a means to scry upon him;
	Bob deactivates it.</li>
    <li>Given the timing, Charles seeks out the priest
	to get leads on who might be after him</li>
    <li>The priest is aware there were some rivals,
	and assures Charles that the guardian angels shall watch over him.</li>
    <li>While slightly out of place in the suburbs,
	some mob toughs begin keeping a protective watch on Charles' house.</li>
    <li>Charles starts to investigate the local gang activity;
	Diane starts trailing some likely leads.</li>
    <li>The FBI show up and have questions about how Charles is mixed up with
	organized crime and reveal that they don't have information on the
	woman whom is often seen with Charles,
	and offer to help Charles if he comes clean.</li>
    <li>Charles conveys that he is a librarian,
	which the FBI agents know is true, yet find puzzling.
	Charles doesn't answer questions about the mystery woman,
	expecting that avoid the topic creates impression that he's likely
	seeing a prostitute.</li>
    <li>The FBI agents eventually leave a card with Charles and depart.</li>
    <li>Working late on research, there is a knock at the door;
	Diane is there, behind her is a mage with spirit magic,
	and flashlight capable of making daylight.</li>
    <li>Charles opens the door; the mage Georgie enters,
	with his eastern European accent, orders Diane to sit,
	and tells Charles that there's a problem with his mob boss.</li>
    <li>Charles tells Georgie that he does not work for the mob boss,
	rather the boss is in his debt;
	and thus maybe one day Charles will be able to call in a favor;
	this changes Georgie's tone.</li>
    <li>Georgie proposes that since there's a bit of a corporate take-over,
	that this is best left to the corporate world,
	to which Charles suggests best left to the <em>corporial</em> world,
	and the other spirit mage expresses full agreement.</li>
    <li>Georgie, departs satisfied; the next day
	Charles arranges to have made a silver ring with a black opal
	made for Diane such that it will refract daylight around her
	and deepen shadows
	to protect her from some magic like the daylight flashlight.</li>
    <li>As 1988 wears on, there is a growing sense that a darkness has awoken,
	felt by all with death magic, and Diane as well.
	Is seems to be somewhere in Asia, perhaps Siberia;
	extremely powerful, ancient,
	and almost as if it is somehow both of death magic
	and also vampiric in nature.</li>
  </ul>
<h3 id="years-of-research">Years of Research</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Charles spends over two years researching how to restore Martha</li>
    <li>The final months of it, he spends with Renier's Wizard,
	and the final steps become far better understood.</li>
    <li>There will be risks, possibly resulting in harm to the casters</li>
    <li>Charles will need the aid of wizards with other types of magic</li>
    <li>Charles delivers a note for Kailani
	detailing the research he has done
	in a safe room of a house of hers</li>
    <li>Charles feels something almost tug at him from the Shadow.</li>
    <li>Diane finds the blood painting Lauraine made to be beautiful,
	it reminds her of birth</li>
  </ul>
<h3 id="wolves-and-vamps">Wolves and Vamps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Charles and Diane are invited to a party at the Temple of Isis</li>
  <li>Fran&#xE7;ois introduces them to Sylvie and some members of her family</li>
  <li>The opening band has a member who is a child if Sylvie; he seems
      strangely familiar to Charles</li>
  <li>The promoter for the band is a vampire who was employing some form of
      magic to gently boost the emotional impact of the music</li>
  <li>Some were-wolves cause a minor disturbance and leave in a hurry</li>
  <li>Sylvie follows and learns that Carol (a werewolf) is missing,
      and Greg her vampire boyfriend is suspect</li>
  <li>Cowboy James contacts Charles because they found Carol's body;
      he wants to find the truth
      and avoid a conflict between vampires and wolves</li>
  <li>Sylvie and Charles arrive at scene, the spirit is not present</li>
  <li>Sylvie examines the body and finds evidence that a werewolf may be the killer</li>
  <li>Sylvie also spots a rat-spirit spying on the scene, and chases it</li>
  <li>Sylvie and Charles capture it, and coerce it to lead them to its master</li>
  <li>The master turns out to be a senior spiral dancer werewolf</li>
  <li>The killer was the son of the head spiral dancer
      and jealous would-be-lover of Carol</li>
  <li>Sylvie and Charles report the findings to James and the werewolves</li>
  <li>The wolves and vampires appreciate the information; conflict is avoided</li>
